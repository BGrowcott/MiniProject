            Human evolution is the evolutionary process within the history of
            primates that led to the emergence of Homo sapiens as a distinct
            species of the hominid family, which includes the great apes. This
            process involved the gradual development of traits such as human
            bipedalism and language, as well as interbreeding with other
            hominins, which indicate that human evolution was not linear but a
            web.

            In sociology, socialization is the process of internalizing the
            norms and ideologies of society. Socialization encompasses both
            learning and teaching and is thus "the means by which social and
            cultural continuity are attained". Socialization is strongly
            connected to developmental psychology. Humans need social
            experiences to learn their culture and to survive.
